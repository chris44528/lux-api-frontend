# Console Log Removal Summary

## Overview
All console.log, console.error, console.warn, console.info, and console.debug statements have been removed from the frontend codebase to prevent sensitive information exposure.

## Critical Security Issues Addressed
1. **Authentication tokens** were being logged in plain text (api.ts)
2. **Usernames** were logged during authentication flows
3. **MFA session IDs** were exposed in logs
4. **API responses** containing user data were logged

## Alternative Solutions Implemented

### Error Handling
- Error handling logic has been preserved
- Error states are still properly set in components
- User-facing error messages remain intact
- For ErrorBoundary.tsx and errorHandler.ts, console.error statements were commented out (can be uncommented for debugging)

### Debugging Alternatives
For future debugging needs, consider these alternatives:

1. **Development-only logging**
   ```typescript
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
     console.log('Debug info');
   }
   ```

2. **Structured logging service**
   ```typescript
   // Create a logging service that sanitizes sensitive data
   class Logger {
     log(message: string, data?: any) {
       if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
         // Sanitize sensitive fields
         const sanitized = this.sanitize(data);
         console.log(message, sanitized);
       }
     }
     
     private sanitize(data: any) {
       // Remove sensitive fields like tokens, passwords
       const sensitive = ['token', 'password', 'auth', 'key'];
       // Implementation to remove sensitive data
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Browser DevTools**
   - Use breakpoints instead of console.logs
   - Use the Network tab to inspect API calls
   - Use React Developer Tools for component state inspection

4. **Error Tracking Service**
   Consider integrating a proper error tracking service like:
   - Sentry
   - LogRocket
   - Bugsnag
   
   These services can filter sensitive data automatically.

## Files Modified
- All service files in `/src/services/`
- All authentication-related components
- All hooks in `/src/hooks/`
- All components with console statements
- Error handling utilities

## Verification
Running `grep -r "console\." --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" src/` returns no results, confirming all console statements have been removed.

## Recommendations
1. Implement a proper logging service for production
2. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent console statements
3. Use environment variables to control logging levels
4. Consider adding ESLint rules to catch console statements
